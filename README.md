For my classmates that may read this, File naming conventions are critical. You should get into the habit now of writing down your naming conventions. The following is an excerpt from: <https://datamanagement.hms.harvard.edu/plan-design/file-naming-conventions#:~:text=Think%20about%20how%20you%20want,%7B%20%7D%20'%20%22%20%7C>

"Include a top-level README file on how to navigate the structure
Naming conventions should be documented so that others...can follow this standard. Document naming conventions in a README.txt and keep it with your files!

If the file is moved or shared, users will be able to identify the file from its file name.
File names should be 40-50 characters and conventions should only use alphanumeric characters, dashes, underscores.
If you find that you are encoding a large amount of metadata in the file names, you should consider storing this metadata in a master spreadsheet with your data for future reference.
 
Example: My file naming convention is [SA-MPL-EID]_[YYYYMMDD]_[###]_[status].[tif]"
